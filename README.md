# NYT Crossword Trainer

This tool allows you to practice crossword clues pulling from a dataset of all NYT crossword clues between 2009 and 2016. There is an executable file called crossword_trainer that should run on Mac, if not then the python script crossword_GUI.py should work for the main app and crossword_term.py for a simpler terminal version.
