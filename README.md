NYT Crossword Trainer

This tool allows you to practice crossword clues pulling from a dataset of all NYT crossword clues between 2009 and 2016. There is an executable file called crossword_trainer in the dist folder that should run on Mac, if not then the python script crossword_GUI.py should work for the main app and crossword_term.py for a simpler terminal version.

## The GUI

The top left is a streak, the ðŸ§Š will change to ðŸ”¥ as your streak goes up. Red outlines boxes are letters that you have revealed and cannot be changed after being revealed. After revealing any amount of letters your streak ends and that clue is not counted as correct.
